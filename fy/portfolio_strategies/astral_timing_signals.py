    """
    Determines timing for buy and sell signals in stock data, based on input parameters.

    Parameters:
    data (pd.DataFrame): The stock data to analyze.
    completion (int): The number of periods to wait before changing the signal.
    step (int): The number of periods to use as the first reference point.
    step_two (int): The number of periods to use as the second reference point.
    what (str): The name of the column in data to use as the comparison.
    high (str): The name of the column in data to use as the high reference point.
    low (str): The name of the column in data to use as the low reference point.
    where_long (str): The name of the column in data to use for long signals.
    where_short (str): The name of the column in data to use for short signals.

    Returns:
    pd.DataFrame: The modified data with long and short signals added.
